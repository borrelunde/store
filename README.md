# Spring Boot: Mastering the Fundamentals - Part 1

Master dependency injection and database integration with Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA

---

This is a companion repository for the course [Spring Boot: Mastering the Fundamentals](https://codewithmosh.com/p/spring-boot-fundamentals) part 1 by [Mosh Hamedani, Code with Mosh](https://codewithmosh.com/).

For the most part, an effort to keep the repository tidy and clean has not been made. It is intended to be a reference for myself in the future where the commit history can be used to see the progression of the project.
